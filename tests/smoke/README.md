# Smoke Tests

Smoke tests aren't designed to validate functionality, they're designed to validate that we didn't fat-finger a function name or pass the wrong type of argument around.

They're really only useful for ensuring the areas of code that we haven't tested in-depth (or have no reason to do deep tests on) don't break unexpectedly.
